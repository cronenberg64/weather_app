I'm making this project for the purpose of understanding APIs in flutter through a project based learning approach

Through this project, or as of writing right now, a lot of the files ended up corrupt the day after I finalized my version which sucks so hopefully as they are right now on github they're not corrupted as I had just fixed those corrupt files (not sure if it did fix it or not)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
